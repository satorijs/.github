  <p>The Universal Messenger Protocol</p>
</div>

Satori is a universal messenger protocol designed to bridge the gap between various chat platforms. Our aim is for Satori to streamline the development of cross-platform, scalable, and high-performance chat applications at a lower cost for developers.

The name "Satori" is inspired by the character [Komeiji Satori](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Satori_Komeiji) from the Touhou Project game series. Komeiji Satori possesses the ability to communicate with various animals through reading their minds. This name reflects our aspiration for Satori to serve as a bridge among different chat platforms.

The development team of Satori has extensive experience in chatbot development and is well-versed in the communication protocols of various chat platforms. After more than four years of continuous development, Satori boasts a robust design and comprehensive implementation. Currently, the official Satori adapters cover over 15 mainstream chat platforms, including Discord, Telegram, QQ, WhatsApp, and more.

These adapters not only provide a plug-and-play experience but also demonstrate the universality and extensibility of the Satori protocol in practice.

There is no need to worry about losing control over chat platforms when using Satori. Thanks to Satori's internal interface mechanism, you can write generic code in most cases and use internal interfaces when necessary to implement platform-specific functionalities.

Moreover, Satori offers a complete set of solutions for scalable scenarios. Whether you're running a chatbot on a personal computer or managing a chat platform backend on a distributed cluster, Satori will satisfy you.
